   MemberWing-X Extension
   ======================

   InfusionSoft will call this script to notify about product purchase event (payment, subscription, etc...)
   Note: other payment events, such as: refund, recurring payments, cancellations, chargebacks are not supported.
         This means that if user purchased product and then refunded - he still will be able to access premium
         content unless you manually remove him from Users list or edit "products owned" inside his user account panel.

   Usage:

   -  Click on product or web form.

   -  Click tab "Actions" or "Setup Actions"

   -  In dropdown choose "Send an http post to another server"

   -  In Post URL - add url of this script and append the name of this product (or form) to query string. Example:
      http://www.YOUR-SITE.com/wp-content/plugins/memberwing-x/extensions/InfusionSoft/post.php?item_name=My+Gold+Membership
      (replace http://www.YOUR-SITE.com - with the correct URL of your wordpress install)

   -  Click [Save] button

   -  When customer buys product or fills in the form:
      -  notification will be sent to this script
      -  new user account will be created
      -  email will be dispatched to user and website administrator with new customer information and login credentials

   -  To create premium article that would allow access only to this customer:
      -  Login to Wordpress admin panel. Create new post or page:
      -  Navigate to Pages->Add new (or Posts->Add new)
      -  Write content of your premium page.
      -  Inside the text of page, after free teaser insert premium marker like this: {{{gold}}} or {{{membership}}}. Such as:
            This is free teaser visible to everyone (and search engines as well)
            {{{gold}}}
            This is premium part visible only to logged on owner of "My Gold Membership" product
      -  MemberWing-X matches string inside the marker - in this case "gold" against list of products that currently logged on user owns.
         If match found (current user owns product with "...gold..." inside the product name) - user will be allowed to read full content of this article.
         If no matches found - user will only see free teaser + link to your subscribe page.
         You will need to create subscribe page if it is not already exists and make sure it's URL is correct in:
            MemberWingX->General Settings->{SUBSCRIBE_URL_PREMIUM}
      -  Note: you may achieve the same premium protection effect by using this marker: {{{membership}}}
         In this case if currently logged on user owns any product with keyword "membership" in it's name - user will be allowed to access current article/page.
      -  Note: keyword matching is case-insensitive.
